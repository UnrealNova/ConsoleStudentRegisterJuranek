The requirement for this application was developed to create a course registration window for students to navigate and sign up for courses that are available easily. 
I did well in setting up the classes for the dropdown box for the classes and setting up the directory, 
making it easy for the student to navigate. 
The necessary features of the console design were made entirely to make it easy for the student to navigate and to assign for the classes. 
It was also made easy for the students to know if their classes were booked or if they tried to sign up for a course they already registered for, 
and it notified them that it was already registered. 
The design successfully ensured that the model stayed simple but efficient without overloading the student with too much on the screen. 
I always debugged every 10-20 lines I wrote to make it easy to make changes over time without making various changes over 50 lines. 
I had to rewrite a few lines to make the program's understanding easier, creating various arrays and gatekeeping functions to protect the information within.
